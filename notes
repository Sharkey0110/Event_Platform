shadcn is a good component libary

1 - clerk is a good auth libaryhave root and auth in different folders
    a .env.local file is needed for clerk, create it
    clerk requires a middleware file
    
    uploadthing for uploading things, weird install setup
    

you can attach layouts to each route group


2 - the backend will be done in mongodb so it needs to be connected, create the folder in the lib folder


3 - to set up a mongo database, go to mongodb, create a new project, select free plan, allow all ips and create a database, get the
    connection code and put it into env with the same name as in your database index (so MONGODB_URI)


4 - databases need models (how data is structured) so you need a models folder in database that has data structures


5 - to cause the database to add users when they join, a webhook is needed that makes a request when clerk code is activated


6 - you need to enable webhooks on the clerk dashboard. The steps to do this are:
    install svix
    create an endpoint in the application by creating an api/webhook/clerk folder and put in the code from the clerk docs

7 - deploy website

8 - after website is deployed go to clerk dashboard and make a new clerk endpoint, copy url and add /api/webhook/clerk
    copy and add to the env file the signing secret generated by adding an endpoint, wipe all users

9 - every time you make changes to github or env, add changes and redeploy

FUCKING WEBHOOKS
- i had an issue where the clerk to mongodb connection didnt happen and data didnt transfer, this was because i specified i wanted
    a first and last name in mongo, but didnt give it in clerk

i think thats everything that needs to be done in a specific order though :)

10 - for any forms use the shad cn docs theyre straight foward, as well as using zod as a validator, external or internal

11 - when using upload thing, create a app on the website and copy the secret in the dashboard to env
    you need a file router when using upload thing, which goes in the api folder as core.ts and route.ts

upload thing is being much more of a prick than clerk, use at own risk
